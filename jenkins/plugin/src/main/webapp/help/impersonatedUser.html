Configures the user which build the jobs (will be run on half of that user).<br><br>
<b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        Make sure the user exists in Jenkins.
    </li>
    <li>
        We strongly recommend specifying a Jenkins user for ALM Octane. Set this user's permissions to the minimum required for this integration: <b>Job Build</b> permissions.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you do not specify a Jenkins user, ALM Octane uses the Anonymous user, and is limited to <b>Anonymous's</b> user permissions.
    </li>
</ul>
